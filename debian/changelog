  [ Robert Millan ]
  * Set urgency=high.  Might seem like a rush, but it can't possibly be worse than
    1.94-5 (broken on systems that use udev, broken on amd64...).
  * Pure ppc64 support.
    - control (Architecture): Add any-ppc64.
    - control (Build-Depends): Add libc6-dev-powerpc [ppc64].
  * rules: Remove moddep.lst install command (no longer needed).
  * patches/03_revert_partition_numbering.diff:  New.  Revert a commit that
    broke grub-probefs.
  * Add bug template to encourage sending upstream stuff directly to
    upstream.
    - presubj: New.

  [ Otavio Salvador ]
  * Add XS-X-Vcs-Svn on control file and point it to our current svn
    repository.
  * Add cvs-snapshot to rules.

grub2 (1.94-6) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Robert Millan ]
  * update-grub:  Set interpreter to /bin/bash to cope with non-POSIX
    extensions.  (mentioned in #361929)
  * patches/03_avoid_recursing_into_dot_static.diff:  New.  Avoid recursing into
    dotdirs (e.g. ".static").

    /dev/fd0 exists when generating device.map.

grub2 (1.94-5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Robert Millan ]
  * control (Build-Depends): s/any-amd64/amd64 kfreebsd-amd64/g (this seems to

grub2 (1.94-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Otavio Salvador ]
  * 01_fix_amd64_building.patch: dropped since it now supports amd64
    native building.
  * Remove convert_kernel26 usage since it's not necessary anymore and due
    initramfs-tools changes it's bug too.
  
  [ Robert Millan ]
  * Fork update-grub from grub legacy, and tweak a few commands in output to
    make it work for grub2.
  * Update README.Debian.in with more recent (and easier) install instructions.
  * Add grub to Conflicts/Replaces.  Too many commands with the same name,
    even if they don't use the same path yet (but will likely do in the
    future, see #361929).
  * Get rid of control.in, which I introduced in 0.6+20040805-1 and turned out
    to be an endless source of problems (and forbidden by policy as well).
  * Fix FTBFS on amd64. Really closes: #372548.
